# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch is a project that allows users to create drawings on a virtual sketchpad.
The application features a grid of squares, which can be colored by clicking and dragging the mouse.
The grid size can be adjusted using a slider, 
and the color of the squares can be changed using a color picker or by clicking on a "Random Color" button. 
The user can also reset the grid and clear individual squares by right-clicking. 
This project is a fun and interactive way to explore the basics of web development and JavaScript.
